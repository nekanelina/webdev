## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

[Detail challenges encountered during the week, such as coding difficulties, time management issues, or project-related obstacles.]

It is hard at the start of the course, because everything is new, and you have to dive in head first in order to learn. Not that much work, but the amount of new programs, and missing techincal skills are making this overwhelming. It is not hard, just a lot, especially when you do not know for example: how to use git, github, terminal, figma, other programs. A steep learning curve I would say.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

[Highlight positive outcomes from the week's activities, successful coding tasks, and any valuable lessons you learned from your experiences.]

Put in the time to watch videos, practise. So happy, that I learned something new, like basics of github.

- Key Learning:

[Summarize the new concepts, techniques, or strategies you learned during the week that have contributed to your understanding and growth.]

Using github. Barely the basics. This is really useful, because most of the material is in github. In addition, you must know how to push your files, so it can be assesed.

- Online Resources:

[List and briefly describe online resources you found useful during the week, whether they were tutorials, articles, forums, or videos.]

Every video that has been provided was useful.

### Coping Strategies:


- Academic Progress:

[Evaluate your academic progress for the week, discussing completed assignments, grades received, and areas where you've improved.]

A few assignments, nothing much.

- Soft Skills Development:

[Reflect on how your soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, contributed to your progress during the week.]

I have gone from group to group in order to find people who are lively and excited about the course. Happy to see I have found them. So those soft skills have definetly been put to use. We discussed ideas, problems. Moreover, it contributed to our team in a positive way.

### Project Management:

[Discuss how agile project management principles influenced your approach to project work and collaboration this week.]

Had to google what they are. But I guess it was used in collaborating and was useful.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the [Web Course] and [Project Course]. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

I agree with this paragraph.



### Next Steps:

[Outline your goals and intentions for the upcoming week, including specific areas you want to focus on.]

I want to learn more how to use github. Learn how to use it faster, more efficiently. Just need practise. I am expecting myself to watch every video and try my best to understand and practise the content that is put out. I know it is useful and crucial if I want to grow.
