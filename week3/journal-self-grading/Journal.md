## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

[Detail challenges encountered during the week, such as coding difficulties, time management issues, or project-related obstacles.]

There were coding difficulties, because the code itself gets more complicated. More knowledge and skill is needed to follow. Had to ask the teacher not once how to move forward. Had to do a lot of homework after the lessons in order to catch up with the activities. There was time-management issues on my side considering other courses, so I had to do some tasks on my free time.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

[Highlight positive outcomes from the week's activities, successful coding tasks, and any valuable lessons you learned from your experiences.]

I managed to figure what was wrong in all the activities this week. I learned that if I want to achieve something I must practise that skill. So im happy about the fact that I put my time and effort in order to achieve that, because the course itself is not so easy so more energy is needed.

- Key Learning:

[Summarize the new concepts, techniques, or strategies you learned during the week that have contributed to your understanding and growth.]

I learned more about frontend, how to use React, convert code, import code. If there were problems I already knew where to look in order to figure them out.

- Online Resources:

[List and briefly describe online resources you found useful during the week, whether they were tutorials, articles, forums, or videos.]

Again, all the material provided by teacher is viewed and learned from. It is useful.
Sometimes it is a lot of material to look through, but you got to do what you got to do for this to work and to grow.

### Coping Strategies:


- Academic Progress:

[Evaluate your academic progress for the week, discussing completed assignments, grades received, and areas where you've improved.]

I am glad that github is getting more efficient for me. The same skills are being practised. Do not know all the basics yet: pulling, branching. Because it is not yet needed, but I do understand more how it works in general. Moreover, I learned about frontend and how to build a web app that is structured from components, so that it is easy to change. Furthermore, from the backend side, I learned what is needed to build an api server wit model-view-controller pattern. 


- Soft Skills Development:

[Reflect on how your soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, contributed to your progress during the week.]

Random pair programming activities pushes me to communicate, try to understand the issues from both sides no matter who is the person or what their personality is. I believe I did well on my soft skills side. It contributed well to my practise and skills growth as well as other peoples.

### Project Management:

[Discuss how agile project management principles influenced your approach to project work and collaboration this week.]

Discussed tasks, who would be comfortable and resposible for what, how should we approach certain problems, our strategy.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the [Web Course] and [Project Course]. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

I do agree with this point. Not going to lie. It is hard. I am trying my best to learn and put every single point so everything comes together in the end.

### Next Steps:

[Outline your goals and intentions for the upcoming week, including specific areas you want to focus on.]

Learn more on upcoming topics, maybe start the project itself and maybe learn more about github pulling and branching. I will see how my energy is for the week.

Week [4]: [13.11]
