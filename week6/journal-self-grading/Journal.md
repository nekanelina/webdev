## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

[Detail challenges encountered during the week, such as coding difficulties, time management issues, or project-related obstacles.]

I did my part for the week, but it was useless, because we introduced new concepts Will re-do that next week.
There was no time management issues, maybe we just failed to communicate adequately.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

[Highlight positive outcomes from the week's activities, successful coding tasks, and any valuable lessons you learned from your experiences.]

Did what I had to do for the project. Learned some coding nuances, did good practise with that.

- Key Learning:

[Summarize the new concepts, techniques, or strategies you learned during the week that have contributed to your understanding and growth.]

This week was just more coding practise. So nothing extraordinary.

- Online Resources:

[List and briefly describe online resources you found useful during the week, whether they were tutorials, articles, forums, or videos.]

Provided youtube videos, watched everything, except the optional or refreshers.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

[Evaluate your academic progress for the week, discussing completed assignments, grades received, and areas where you've improved.]

Improving on coding. Not much, but enough for me.

- Soft Skills Development:

[Reflect on how your soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, contributed to your progress during the week.]

Bit of miscommunication. I will try better on my end. Althought, the team helped to problem solve the clashes when merging. Had meetings, as we usually do. Everyone is trying.

### Project Management:

[Discuss how agile project management principles influenced your approach to project work and collaboration this week.]

Were naturally doing a bit less scrum management. I believe it is because its getting a bit more confusing and complex.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the [Web Course] and [Project Course]. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

Just trying to go along and not fall back.

### Next Steps:

[Outline your goals and intentions for the upcoming week, including specific areas you want to focus on.]
