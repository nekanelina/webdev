## Peer assessment

Evaluate the performance of each member of your group. **Remember** to **evaluate yourself as well**!

- Group Member's Name
  Rate on a Scale of 1-5
  Justify Your Answer: The group member's ability to collaborate, role in the task, how they managed their part, motivation etc.

Vladimir - 5
Augustas - 4
Sami - 5
Balde - 5

Everyone did their part. I did not add/participate as much due to other courses, so the grading is lesser for me.

## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

[Detail challenges encountered during the week, such as coding difficulties, time management issues, or project-related obstacles.]

It was more technical coding and then some css styling. Not as difficult, but important nonetheless.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

[Highlight positive outcomes from the week's activities, successful coding tasks, and any valuable lessons you learned from your experiences.]

Happy that I searched for tasks myself, found things to consider and worked on them when I have found the time for that. Time management has been successful I would say.

- Key Learning:

[Summarize the new concepts, techniques, or strategies you learned during the week that have contributed to your understanding and growth.]

This week was just more coding practise. So nothing extraordinary. More github learning, that is always welcome.

- Online Resources:

[List and briefly describe online resources you found useful during the week, whether they were tutorials, articles, forums, or videos.]

Did not watch all the videos, but tried to watch some at least.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

[Evaluate your academic progress for the week, discussing completed assignments, grades received, and areas where you've improved.]

Did not improve as much, because the work was more repetitive, but I am happy about my addition to the project. Couldnt understand some activities, but thats okay.

- Soft Skills Development:

[Reflect on how your soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, contributed to your progress during the week.]

Communicated clearly, everyone knows what others will be doing. Happy about that. If some problem arises, team members are glad to help.

### Project Management:

[Discuss how agile project management principles influenced your approach to project work and collaboration this week.]

Were naturally doing a bit less scrum management. I believe it is because its getting a bit more confusing and complex.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the [Web Course] and [Project Course]. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

Just trying to go along and not fall back.

### Next Steps:

[Outline your goals and intentions for the upcoming week, including specific areas you want to focus on.]
